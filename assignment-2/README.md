# Assignment 2 — ER Diagram (Doctor Booking System)

## Objective
Design the Entity–Relationship diagram for a Doctor Booking System and explain it with a short Loom video.

## Files in this folder
- `Dr._Booking_System_ER_Diagram.png` — the ER diagram image (open to view).
- `README.md` — this file (explanation + Loom link).

## Explanation
The ER diagram models the relationships required to support appointments, patients, doctors, clinics, slots, and basic payment/feedback artifacts. See the PNG for entity shapes and relationships.

## Notes to reviewer
- No runtime required. The diagram + video explain the design choices.
- If you want the diagram in a different format (PDF or editable file), tell me and I will add it to this folder.
